# Incident-Response-Detect-Analyze-Mitigate
This project simulates and analyzes an ARP spoofing attack in a controlled lab using Kali Linux and Wireshark. It shows how attackers intercept network traffic and credentials, then applies defenses like static ARP, Arp watch, HTTPS, VPN, and IDS tools, providing hands-on experience in detection, analysis, and mitigation.
