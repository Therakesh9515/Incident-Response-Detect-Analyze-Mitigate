# Incident-Response-Detect-Analyze-Mitigate
This project simulates and analyzes an ARP spoofing attack in a controlled lab using Kali Linux and Wireshark. It shows how attackers intercept network traffic and credentials, then applies defenses like static ARP, Arp watch, HTTPS, VPN, and IDS tools, providing hands-on experience in detection, analysis, and mitigation.

# 🚨 Incident Response – Detect, Analyze & Mitigate

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the detection, analysis, and mitigation of a common network attack known as **ARP Spoofing**.  
The attack was simulated in a controlled lab setup using Kali Linux (attacker), a victim machine, and monitoring tools.  
It provided practical experience in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity techniques.

## 📝 Abstract
- Simulated **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack using ARP spoofing.  
- Identified devices on the local network with **Net Discover**.  
- Launched ARP spoof attack to intercept victim–gateway communication.  
- Captured and analyzed traffic using **Wireshark**.  
- Observed spoofed ARP replies where attacker’s MAC replaced the gateway’s.  
- Mitigation included:
  - ARP-A  
  - Arpwatch monitoring  
  - Static ARP entries  
  - HTTPS & VPN encryption  
  - IDS tools (Snort, Sucuri)

## ❗ Problem Statement
Cyberattacks like ARP spoofing are a serious risk because:
- Hackers send fake ARP replies to redirect traffic.  
- This allows them to **steal credentials, alter data, or disrupt services**.  
- Small and medium-sized networks are more vulnerable due to lack of monitoring.  

This project simulates ARP spoofing in a safe lab environment and applies **detection & mitigation techniques**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. Set up and run ARP spoofing attack in a controlled lab.  
2. Monitor real-time traffic with **Wireshark**.  
3. Detect spoofing indicators (mismatched MAC, unusual ARP).  
4. Analyze the impact on communication and data security.  
5. Apply preventive measures (Static ARP, IDS, VPN).  
6. Document findings with screenshots and logs.

## ⚙️ Project Implementation Steps
1. **Discover Devices** – Identify victim, attacker, gateway using Net Discover.  
2. **Start ARP Spoofing** – Redirect victim’s traffic via attacker.  
3. **Capture Traffic with Wireshark** – Monitor ARP/HTTP packets.  
4. **Analyze Packets** – Detect spoofed ARP replies, credentials leakage.  
5. **Apply Mitigations** – Use static ARP, Arpwatch, IDS, HTTPS/VPN.

## 🖥️ GUI-Based Application
Along with the command-line execution, this project also includes a **GUI-based application** for managing incident response steps.  
The GUI helps beginners easily:
- Start/Stop ARP spoof detection  
- View captured logs visually  
- Apply mitigation with one click

## 📚 Conclusion
This project provided practical insight into:  
- How **ARP spoofing** works in real-world scenarios.  
- How to detect spoofed ARP replies and suspicious traffic.  
- How preventive measures (IDS, VPN, HTTPS, Static ARP) strengthen security.  

By simulating both **attack** and **defense**, this project improved understanding of **incident response strategies** in cybersecurity.
